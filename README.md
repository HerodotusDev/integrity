## Prerequisites

To use the verifier with contracts deployed on Starknet, you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html) installed. Also make sure to update [snfoundry.toml](./snfoundry.toml) file with appropriate `account` name and RPC `url`.

For running locally and development, you will need [scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) (we recommend using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager).

## Using Verifier contracts on Starknet

Integrity verifier is deployed on Starknet and can be used for verifying proofs onchain. The intended way of using the verifier is through FactRegistry contract, which besides running the verification process, also stores data for all verified proofs. (For more information see [FactRegistry and Proxy contract](#factregistry-and-proxy-contract))

There are two ways of serializing proof into calldata: monolith and split proof. The former should be used if possible, because it's easier and more efficient. The latter should only be used if monolith proof did not fit in a single transaction, either because of calldata limit or steps limit.

### Monolith proof

Calldata for monolith proof can be generated with the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin proof_serializer < examples/proofs/recursive/cairo0_stone5_keccak_160_lsb_example_proof.json > examples/calldata
```

After that, you can use `verify-on-starknet.sh` script to send the transaction to FactRegistry contract. Remember to select appropriate settings for your proof. For more information on supported settings, see [Configure Verifier](#configure-verifier).

For example, run:

```bash
./verify-on-starknet.sh 0x4ce7851f00b6c3289674841fd7a1b96b6fd41ed1edc248faccd672c26371b8c examples/calldata recursive keccak_160_lsb stone5 strict
```

This bash script internally calls `verify_proof_full_and_register_fact` function on FactRegistry contract.

### Split proof

To generate split calldata, please refer to [Calldata Generator README](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/integrity-calldata-generator/blob/main/README.md). This repository also provides script for automatic transaction sending (proof verification is split into multiple transactions, for more information see [Split Verifier Architecture](#split-verifier-architecture)).

## FactRegistry and Proxy contract

Since verifier can be configured in many ways and some parts of the logic changes with new stone versions, a contract which routes calls to the correct verifier is needed. This task is handled by FactRegistry contract that also stores data for all verified proofs.

After proof is verified, `FactRegistered` event is emitted which contains `fact_hash`, `verification_hash`, `security_bits` and `settings`. `fact_hash` is a value that represents proven program and its output (formally `fact_hash = poseidon_hash(program_hash, output_hash)`). Remember that registration of some `fact_hash` doesn't necessary mean that it has been verified by someone with secure enough proof. You always need to check `security_bits` and `settings` which is part of `verification_hash` (formally `verification_hash = poseidon_hash(fact_hash, security_bits, settings)`).

For more detailed and visual representation of those hash calculations, check out [Integrity Hashes Calculator](https://integrity-hashes-calculator.vercel.app/) tool. It generates all mentioned hashes for arbitrary user input and even proof JSON file.

`FactRegistry` provides two methods for checking verified proofs:

-   `get_verification(verification_hash)` - returns fact hash, security bits and settings for given `verification_hash`.
-   `get_all_verifications_for_fact_hash(fact_hash)` - returns list of all verification hashes, security bits and settings for given `fact_hash`. This method is useful for checking if given program has been verified by someone with secure enough proof.

FactRegistry contract is trustless which means that the owner of the contract can't override or change any existing behavior, they can only add new verifiers. Proxy contract on the other hand is upgradable, so every function can be changed or removed. It has the advantage of having all future updates of the verifier logic without having to replace the address of FactRegistry contract. Proxy contract provides the same interface as FactRegistry with additional `get_fact_registry` method which returns address of FactRegistry contract.

## Calls from Starknet contracts

Since integrity is deployed on Starknet, other contracts can call FactRegistry to check whether certain proof has been verified. Integrity can be used as a dependency of your cairo1 project by including it in project's `Scarb.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
integrity = "2.0.0"
```

The package provides many utility functions for interacting with the verifier. For contract calls, you can use `Integrity` struct which provides following methods:

-   `new() -> Integrity` - creates new interface for interacting with official FactRegistry (contract address is set automatically).
-   `new_proxy() -> Integrity` - creates new interface using official Proxy contract (contract address is set automatically).
-   `from_address(address: ContractAddress) -> Integrity` - create new interface using custom FactRegistry deployment.
-   `is_fact_hash_valid_with_security(self: Integrity, fact_hash: felt252, security_bits: u32) -> bool` - checks if given `fact_hash` has been verified with at least `security_bits` number of security bits.
-   `is_verification_hash_valid(self: Integrity, verification_hash: felt252) -> bool` - checks if given `verification_hash` has been verified.
-   `with_config(self: Integrity, verifier_config: VerifierConfiguration, security_bits: u32) -> IntegrityWithConfig` - returns new interface with custom verifier configuration.
-   `with_hashed_config(self: Integrity, verifier_config_hash: felt252, security_bits: u32) -> IntegrityWithConfig` - returns new interface with custom verifier configuration given its hash.

On `IntegrityWithConfig` interface you can call:

-   `is_fact_hash_valid(self: IntegrityWithConfig, fact_hash: felt252) -> bool` - checks if given `fact_hash` has been verified with selected config.

There are also few utility function for calculating hashes:

-   `get_verifier_config_hash(verifier_config: VerifierConfiguration) -> felt252` - calculates hash for given verifier configuration, which is used necessary for calculating verification hash.
-   `get_verification_hash(fact_hash: felt252, verifier_config_hash: felt252, security_bits: u32) -> felt252` - calculates verification hash for given `fact_hash`, `verifier_config_hash` and `security_bits`.
-   `calculate_fact_hash(program_hash: felt256, output: Span<felt252>) -> felt252` - calculates fact hash for given `program_hash` and `output` array.
-   `calculate_bootloaded_fact_hash(bootloader_program_hash: felt252, child_program_hash: felt252, child_output: Span<felt252>) -> felt252` - calculates fact hash for program that was bootloaded with standard bootloader.
-   `calculate_wrapped_bootloaded_fact_hash(wrapper_program_hash: felt252, bootloader_program_hash: felt252, child_program_hash: felt252, child_output: Span<felt252>) -> felt252` - calculates fact hash for a wrapped and bootloaded with the standard bootloader.

Available constants are:

-   `INTEGRITY_ADDRESS` - address of official FactRegistry contract deployed on Starknet Sepolia
-   `PROXY_ADDRESS` - address of official Proxy contract deployed on Starknet Sepolia
-   `SHARP_BOOTLOADER_PROGRAM_HASH` - program hash of the bootloader used by SHARP prover
-   `STONE_BOOTLOADER_PROGRAM_HASH` - program hash of [Custom Stone Bootloader](https://github.com/Okm165/cairo1-cairo0bootloader/blob/master/cairo0-bootloader/bootloader/recursive/simple_bootloader.cairo)

Example:

```
use integrity::{Integrity, IntegrityWithConfig, calculate_bootloaded_fact_hash, SHARP_BOOTLOADER_PROGRAM_HASH, VerifierConfiguration};

fn is_fibonacci_verified(fib_index: felt252, fib_value: felt252) -> bool {
    let SECURITY_BITS = 70;
    let fibonacci_program_hash = 0x59874649ccc5a0a15ee77538f1eb760acb88cab027a2d48f4246bf17b7b7694;
    let fact_hash = calculate_bootloaded_fact_hash(
        SHARP_BOOTLOADER_PROGRAM_HASH, fibonacci_program_hash, [fib_index, fib_value].span()
    );

    let integrity = Integrity::new();
    integrity.is_fact_hash_valid_with_security(fact_hash, SECURITY_BITS)
}

fn is_multi_fibonacci_verified(fib: Span<(felt252, felt252)>) -> bool {
    let config = VerifierConfiguration {
        layout: 'recursive_with_poseidon',
        hasher: 'keccak_160_lsb',
        stone_version: 'stone6',
        memory_verification: 'relaxed',
    };
    let SECURITY_BITS = 96;
    let fibonacci_program_hash = 0x59874649ccc5a0a15ee77538f1eb760acb88cab027a2d48f4246bf17b7b7694;

    let integrity = Integrity::new().with_config(config, SECURITY_BITS);

    let mut ret = true;
    for f in fib {
        let (fib_index, fib_value) = *f;
        let fact_hash = calculate_bootloaded_fact_hash(
            SHARP_BOOTLOADER_PROGRAM_HASH, fibonacci_program_hash, [fib_index, fib_value].span()
        );

        if !integrity.is_fact_hash_valid(fact_hash) {
            ret = false;
        }
    };
    ret
}
```

## Running locally

To run the verifier locally, first you need to build cairo project using:

```bash
scarb build
```

The verifier by default is configured in recursive layout and keccak hasher. If you want to build for other layouts, refer to [Configure Verifier](#configure-verifier)

### Running the Verifier on Example Proof

You can use cairo runner to run the verifier on example proof:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin runner -- \
--program target/dev/integrity.sierra.json \
--memory-verification strict \
--stone-version stone5 \
--hasher-bit-length 160_lsb \
< examples/proofs/recursive/cairo0_stone5_keccak_160_lsb_example_proof.json
```

### Configure Verifier

By default, the verifier is configured for monolith version, recursive layout and keccak hash for verifier unfriendly commitment layers. You can easily change that by using scarb's features:

```bash
scarb build --no-default-features --features small,blake2s,monolith
```

-   `layout`
    -   `dex`
    -   `recursive`
    -   `recursive_with_poseidon`
    -   `small`
    -   `starknet`
    -   `starknet_with_keccak`
-   hash functions:
    -   `keccak`
    -   `blake2s`
-   verifier types
    -   `monolith`
    -   `split`

There are also additional settings that can be configured at runtime:

-   `memory_verification`
    -   `strict`
    -   `relaxed`
    -   `cairo1`
-   `stone_version`
    -   `stone5`
    -   `stone6`
-   hasher bit length
    -   `160_lsb`
    -   `248_lsb`

Hash function and hasher bit length are combined into one setting:

-   `hasher`
    -   `keccak_160_lsb`
    -   `blake2s_160`
    -   `blake2s_248_lsb`

For `stone5` available hashers are `keccak_160_lsb` and `blake2s_160`, for `stone6` - `keccak_160_lsb` and `blake2s_248_lsb`.

### Running tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
scarb test
```

### Benchmarking

In order to launch benchmarking, just run this (it requires recursive layout configuration):

```bash
cargo run --release --bin benches -- target/dev/integrity.sierra.json
```

## Deployment

If you want to deploy the verifier yourself, please follow these steps:

1. Deploy FactRegistry contract

```bash
bash deployment/fact_registry/deploy.sh
```

2. (optional) Deploy Proxy contract

```bash
bash deployment/proxy/deploy.sh
bash deployment/proxy/set_fact_registry.sh
```

3. Deploy and register Verifier contracts

Make sure to replace `<layout>` and `<hasher>` with appropriate names.

```bash
sncast multicall run --fee-token eth --path deployment/verifiers/<layout>/<hasher>/deploy.toml
bash deployment/verifiers/<layout>/<hasher>/register.sh
```

## Split Verifier Architecture

Because of great complexity of the verifier compared to standard starknet contracts, we encounter some limitations enforced by starknet. The most important ones are:

-   Contract classhash size limit
-   Transaction calldata limit
-   Transaction steps limit

To overcome these limitations, we split the verifier into multiple contracts and transactions. The biggest part of classhash size is autogenerated (e.g. [recursive autogenerated](/src/air/layouts/recursive/autogenerated.cairo)), so we extracted that part into separate contract (or many contracts in case of `starknet_with_keccak` layout), which is called automatically by the main verifier contract. On the other hand the biggest part of calldata is fri witness, so user can send subsequent chunks of fri witness in separate step transactions.
